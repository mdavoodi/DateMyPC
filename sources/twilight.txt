 You are my life now.
 Are you going to tell me how you stopped the van?
 Is she even Italian?
 Who are they?
 Smile!
 I can't ever lose control with you.
 Oh, still stubborn, aren't we? Is that what makes you so special to Edward?
 Beautiful. Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well.
 The hunt is his obsession. He's never gonna stop!
 Will you tell me the truth?
 How did you get over to me so fast?
 Look, You gotta give me some answers.
 Cute, Mike. Let a playa play!
 I should go back there and rip those guys' heads off.
 Did you follow me?
 Did he hurt you?
 Hi Bella! I'm Alice.
 I borrowed this from your house. Hope you don't mind.
 Son, enough. Remember who you are.
 I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me to Forks. They also brought me to Edward.
 Hey you're from Arizona right?
 I'd never given much though to how I would die. But dying in place of someone I love, seems like a good way to go. I can't bring myself to regret the decisions that brought me face to face with death. They also brought me to Edward.
 I'm down with the kids.
 Edible art?
 Hey dad I have a date with Edward Cullen.
 You can't leave me!
 Mom, can I talk to you later?
 "Nice kitty!"
 I leave you alone for two minutes and the wolves descend.
 Was that as weird for you as it was for me?
 Can I talk to you for a minute?
 My family, we're different from others of our kind. We only drink animal blood, but it's your scent. It's like a drug to me. It's like you're my own personal brand of heroin.
 Do you trust me?
 Could you act human? Okay, I have neighbors.
 Put your hair down.
 Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.
 What's in Jacksonville
 You've got to make a choice, Edward, to prevent the change from happening.
 So what are they really?
 It's time.
 I've never given much thought to how I would die. But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go. So, I can't bring my self to regret the decisions to leave home. I would miss Phoenix, I would miss the heat. I would miss my loving, erratic, hare-brained mother, and her new husband.
 Tell Edward how it hurts! Tell him to avenge you! Tell him! TELL HIM!
 I heard the Chief's daughter was in here.
 How did you get in here?
 Yeah, hey! La Push, baby! You in?
 What happened? Where's James?
 I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.
 I don't know.
 Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom. I totally thought Mike was gonna ask you, actually. Um, it's not gonna be weird though, right?
 I'd rather die than to stay away from you.
 I don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
 Edward, stop. Her blood is clean. You're killing her. Stop. Find the will.
 You and Cullen huh?
 I just wanna try one thing.
 Clair de Lune is great.
 What did you expect? Coffins and dungeons and moats?
 And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.
 That's what you dream about? Being a monster?
 Carlisle, what's going on?
 Hey. Come to visit your truck?
 Why? What is she to me?
 My monkey man!
 Everybody's staring.
 No one will surrender tonight, but I won't give in. I know what I want.
 Hold on tight, spidermonkey.
 Death is peaceful - easy. Life is harder.
 Here's your veggie plate, Stephanie.
 Hey, Mikey - you met my home girl, Bella
 I hate you for making me want you so much.
 Ladies first.
 You don't know how long I've waited for you.
 Maybe he'll adopt me.
 Why didn't you move with your mother and Phil?
 Do you do this a lot?
 Looks like the Newton boy's got a big smile for ya'.
 You guys should keep Bella company. Umm. her date bailed.
 What's in Jacksonville?
 You know everybody's staring?
 How did you get in here?
 You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale white, and ice cold. Your eyes change color and sometimes you speak like - like you're from a different time. You never eat or drink anything; you don't go into the sunlight.
 Uh, yeah this is my room.
 I believe this belongs to you.
 Edward, I said leave me alone.
 About three things I was absolutely positive
 Ah you brought a snack.
 Shh I'm here.
 What is it? What do you see?
 Shall we?
 Your hair's longer
 Bella, I'm glad you're here. We need an umpire.
 See, I told you she'd love it. I'm down with the kids.
 Whoa whoa! Chillax! No feature!
 LaPush, baby! You in?
 You're like my own personal brand of heroin.
 Well hello.
 Chief Swan? I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward Cullen.
