Kiss me if I'm wrong, but dinosaurs still exist, right?
If nothing lasts forever, will you be my nothing?
You are like a candy bar: half sweet and half nuts.
Excuse me, but does this smell like chloroform to you?
Are you going to kiss me or do I have to lie to my diary?
The only thing your eyes haven't told me is your name.
I'm new in town. Could you give me directions to your apartment?
Your eyes are blue, like the ocean. And baby, I'm lost at sea.
My name isn't Elmo, but you can tickle me any time you want to.
What does it feel like to be the most beautiful girl in this room?
This isn't a beer belly, It's a fuel tank for a love machine.
You're hotter than donut grease.
Are your parents retarded, 'cause you sure are special.
Your hand looks heavy. Let me hold it for you.
Hey baby, let's play house, you can be the door and I'll slam you all night long!
Are those jeans Guess? Cause guess who wants to be inside them...
I wanna put my thingy into your thingy.
Excuse me, I am about to go masturbate and needed a name to go with the face.
With great penis, comes great responsibility.
You're like my own personal brand of heroin.
This may seem corny, but you make me really horny.
[What are you doing?] I'm taking off my shoes. [Why?] So I can take off my pants.
Do you believe in free love? Then how much do you cost?
You have a beautiful voice. I bet it would sound even better muffled by my penis.
Hi, will you help me find my lost puppy? I think he went into this cheap motel room across the street.
Want to spend the night at my house tonight? The couch may not pull out, but I do.
The FBI wants to steal my penis. Can I hide it inside you?
